/** @brief Interface to the core windows manager.
 *
 * The implementation of this interface is the core manager of root
 * windows (or main windows). It is used to support various multiwindow
 * features.
 *
 * Since the implementation is guaranteed to have signals (see the
 * protected functions below), it also has a GetQObject() method that
 * returns a QObject that can be used to expose these signals.
 *
 * \section MultiwindowNotes Multiple window notes
 *
 * There is always at least one window (that is, with the index 0). It is
 * the window initially created during LeechCraft startup, and currently
 * it cannot be destroyed at all (though this may change some time in the
 * future).
 *
 * There is a concept of preferred window. It's the window best used to
 * be a parent of a message box, or used to determine the preferred
 * screen on a multiscreen system, etc. Typically, it is the window that
 * currently has focus. The functions GetPreferredWindowIndex() and
 * GetPreferredWindow() are used to get the currently preferred window.
 *
 * Window indices are simply indices in some internal data structure.
 * That's why if a window gets removed all indices following it get
 * invalidated (in fact, decremented by one).
