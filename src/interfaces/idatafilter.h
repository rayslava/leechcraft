/** @brief Base interface for data filter plugins.
 *
 * Data filter plugins provide some means to manipulate and alter data.
 * Examples of such plugins are image uploaders to various image bins,
 * text finders, etc.
 *
 * A single data filter plugin can support multiple data filter
 * variants, like particular image bins supported by an image uploader
 * or particular OpenSearch engines supported by an OpenSearch handler.
 * The list of possible data filter variants is returned from the
 * GetFilterVariants() function. The list can be dynamic (that is,
 * different in different calls).
 *
 * Plugins implementing this interface are also expected to implement
 * IEntityHandler, considering (and accepting) entities with MIME
 * "x-leechcraft/data-filter-request". Such entities will contain the
 * entity to filter (like, a piece of text or an image) in the
 * LeechCraft::Entity::Entity_ field and may contain the "DataFilter"
 * key in the LeechCraft::Entity::Additional_ map with the ID of the
 * exact filter variant to use (if user has already selected it).
 *
 * \subsection Data filter callbacks
 *
 * The result of the data filter, if any, can be passed to the plugin
 * emitting the entity. For this the emitting plugin shall set the
 * callback function as the value of the \em DataFilterCallback
 * LeechCraft::Entity::Additional_ map. The function is expected to be an
 * object of type DataFilterCallback_f.
 *
 * @note Not all data filter plugins support callbacks. For example, it
 * doesn't make sense for a Google web search data filter to pass the
 * results page contents or URL to the callback. The behavior is expected
 * to be sane enough, though, for the combination of the filtered entity
 * and callback semantics to make sense.
