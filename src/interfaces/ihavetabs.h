/** @brief Interface for plugins that have one or more tabs.
 *
 * Each plugin that may have tabs in LeechCraft should implement this
 * interface.
 *
 * Plugins implementing this interface may have one or more tabs of
 * different semantics, like chat tabs and service discovery tabs in an
 * IM or download tab and hub browse tab in a DirectConnect plugin.
 *
 * Different tabs with different semantics are said to belong to
 * different tab classes. Different tab classes may have different
 * behavior, but tabs of the same tab class are considered to be
 * semantically equivalent. For example, there may be only one opened
 * tab with the list of active downloads at a time, but there may be
 * many simultaneously opened tabs for hub browsing. Tab behavior is
 * defined by the LeechCraft::TabFeature enum.
 *
 * Different tab classes may have different priorities. The priorities
 * system is used to try to guess the most-currently-wanted tab by the
 * user. When user requests a new tab, but doesn't specify its type (for
 * example, just hits Ctrl+T), priorities of two tab classes are
 * compared: the priority of the class of the current tab and the
 * highest priority among all the tabs. If current priority plus some
 * delta is higher than maximum one, a new instance of current tab class
 * is opened, otherwise the tab with the highest priority is opened. For
 * example, if web browser tab has priority of 80, text editor — 70 and
 * search plugin — 60, and delta is 15, then if current tab is web
 * browser or search plugin, the new tab will be a web browser tab (since
 * 60 + 15 < 80), but if the current tab is text editor's one, then the
 * new tab will also be a text editor (70 + 15 > 80).
 *
 * In future implementations user may be allowed to adjust the delta and
 * priorities of different classes to his liking.
 *
 * @note You mustn't use tab-related signals before SecondInit() has
 * been called on your plugin, but you may use them in SecondInit() or
 * later.
