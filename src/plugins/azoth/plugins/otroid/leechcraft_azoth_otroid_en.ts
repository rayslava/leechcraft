This takes quite some time (from a few seconds to a couple of minutes), and while you can use LeechCraft in the meantime, all the messages will be sent unencrypted until keys are generated. You will be notified when this process finishes. Do you want to generate keys now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also move mouse randomily to help generating entropy.</source>
