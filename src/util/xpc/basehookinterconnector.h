	/** @brief Base class for signal-slot relays in plugin APIs.
	 *
	 * This class is typically used by plugins that support other plugins
	 * to relay signals from the internals of the root plugin to the
	 * subplugins.
	 *
	 * The interconnector automatically connects its signals with the
	 * matching slots (that is, with the same name and parameters) of
	 * subplugins added to it via AddPlugin(), and connects signals of
	 * the objects added via RegisterHookable() to its own matching
	 * signals.
	 *
	 * The usage is as follows:
	 * -# One subclasses from this class and lists all the signals that
	 *    should ever be relayed to plugins in the signals section of the
	 *    subclass. First parameter of the signals should always be
	 *    LeechCraft::IHookProxy_ptr.
	 * -# One adds the instance objects of the subplugins to the
	 *    interconnector via the AddPlugin() method.
	 * -# One registers the objects emitting signals that need to be
	 *    relayed to plugins via the RegisterHookable() method.
	 * -# Everything works.
	 *
	 * Please note that second and third steps can be done in arbitrary
	 * order and even be interleaved.
