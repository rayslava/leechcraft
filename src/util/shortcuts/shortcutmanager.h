	 *
	 * This class serves as a "collector" for different QActions and
	 * QShortcuts. One typically instantiates an object of this class
	 * as a per-plugin global object (via a singleton, for example),
	 * registers all required actions via the RegisterShortcut(),
	 * RegisterAction() and RegisterActionInfo() functions and relays
	 * calls to the IHaveShortcuts::SetShortcut() and
	 * IHaveShortcuts::GetActionInfo() functions to this class.
	 *
	 * Though one can register actions at arbitrary points of time,
	 * only those "kinds" of actions registered during the IInfo::Init()
	 * will be visible to the LeechCraft core. Actions added later will
	 * still have customized shortcuts (if any), but only if another
	 * action with the same ID has been added during IInfo::Init().
	 *
	 * ShortcutManager also supports global shortcuts via the
	 * RegisterGlobalShortcut() and AnnounceGlobalShorcuts() methods.
	 *
	 * See the documentation for IHaveShortcuts for more information
	 * about actions and their IDs.
